        "summary": "This is a fixed-interest loan for a vehicle. You'll pay an 8.5% annual interest rate. You need to make a down payment of ¥300,000 and then pay monthly installments (EMIs) of ¥23,648. There are upfront processing fees totaling ¥17,070, covering various charges like loan processing, credit report, vehicle inspection, and hypothecation. Vehicle insurance is mandatory. If you pay your EMI late, you'll face increasing penal interest (1-3% per annum on the overdue amount) and additional costs for delays, reminder notices, legal notices, bounced cheques, late insurance renewal, or not submitting vehicle documents. You can terminate the loan early by fully prepaying it, but you need to give 30 days' written notice. The lender can terminate the loan and repossess the vehicle if you default, for example, by not paying your EMI for more than 15 days, letting your insurance lapse, violating hypothecation terms, or providing false information.",

This clarity helps avoid surprises, even if the penalties themselves are steep.\n*   **High transparency:** All key financial figures like interest rate, down payment, EMI, and processing fees are clearly disclosed, along with mandatory insurance and termination clauses.\n*   **Low down payment (relative to loan value, implied):** While ¥300,000 is a specific figure, if it represents a smaller percentage of the total vehicle cost, it can be seen as making the loan more accessible.\n\n**Areas that slightly reduce fairness (but not critically):**\n*   **Restricted termination (for borrower):** While early prepayment is allowed 'without penalty,' the 30-day written notice requirement gives the lender some control over the final settlement process. The lender's termination rights are also quite broad and can be exercised for minor defaults."
